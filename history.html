  <h2>Geographical and Environmental Background</h2>
  <div class="card">
  
    <div class="card-content">
      <p>
        <b></b>

        Jharkhand is situated on the ancient Chotanagpur Plateau, one of the oldest landmasses on Earth, geologically belonging to the Precambrian age. This plateau is formed of granite, gneiss, schist, quartzite, and metamorphic rocks that are more than 3 billion years old. The land’s rugged terrain, covered with dense forests, numerous hills, and several fast-flowing rivers like the Subarnarekha, Koel, Damodar, and Barakar, created a natural fortress for early inhabitants. These forests provided food, shelter, medicinal herbs, and raw materials, shaping the lifestyle of the people who lived here. The plateau also contains some of the richest mineral deposits in India—coal fields of Jharia and Bokaro, iron ore in Singhbhum, uranium in Jaduguda, copper in Ghatsila, mica in Koderma, bauxite in Netarhat, limestone in Hazaribagh—and these resources would later play a crucial role in industrial development and colonial exploitation.

  <h2>Prehistoric Era (10,000 BCE – 1500 BCE)</h2>
  <div class="card">
  
    <div class="card-content">
      <p>
        Archaeological discoveries prove that Jharkhand was inhabited by humans since the Paleolithic age. Stone tools, hand-axes, scrapers, blades, and microliths have been found in Singhbhum, Ranchi, Hazaribagh, Palamu, and Gumla. The rock art of Isko (Hazaribagh) is among the most significant prehistoric sites in India. These cave paintings, dating back to Mesolithic times, depict hunting scenes, dancing figures, animals, weaponry, and ritual activities. This shows the artistic, symbolic, and spiritual development of early inhabitants. Similar cave art has been found in Lampo (Pakur) and Gonda Hills (Latehar). These early settlers were hunter-gatherers who later began primitive agriculture in river valley areas. Their tools indicate knowledge of stone polishing, hunting strategies, food processing, and early community life.
      </p>
      <p>By the Neolithic period, communities began to settle in semi-permanent villages. Evidence in the form of polished stone axes and pottery fragments suggest early cultivation of millets, barley, and forest grains. They domesticated cattle and depended heavily on forest produce. These early tribes form the ancestral roots of today’s Munda, Ho, Santhal, Asur, Kharia, Birhor, and other tribal groups.</p>

  <h2>Ethnic Origins and Tribal Formation</h2>
  <div class="card">
  
    <div class="card-content">
      <p>
        <b></b>

        Jharkhand’s tribal population represents some of the oldest ethnic groups of South Asia. The Proto-Australoid tribes—Munda, Ho, Santhal, Asur, Birhor—are considered among the earliest settlers in India, arriving thousands of years before the Aryans. The Oraon (Kurukh) tribe belongs to the Dravidian family and is believed to have migrated from the south, possibly from the region of modern-day Karnataka. Dravidian linguistic patterns found in Kurukh support this theory.
      </p>
      <p>The tribal societies were organized into clans, each clan having its own totem, ancestral stories, and rituals. Their social structure was egalitarian, without caste hierarchy. Community land ownership, joint farming, and shared natural resources formed the basis of their economy. Justice systems were managed through village councils headed by chiefs like the Manaki (village head) and Munda (clan head). Religion was animistic and nature-based—worshipping forest gods, sun, moon, ancestors, and spirits. Sacred groves called Sarna were central to religious life. Festivals like Sarhul, Sohrai, Karma, and Baha celebrated the seasons and nature.</p>

  <div class="card">
  
    <div class="card-content">
      <p>
       

        Ancient Indian texts contain indirect references to the forested regions that correspond to present-day Jharkhand.

          <li>The Mahabharata refers to it as Kukkutaranaya, a forested land inhabited by fierce tribes.
          </li> 
          <li>The Puranas mention regions like Prajapati, Kunkun Desh, and the term Atavika Janapada (forest region).
          </li>

          <li>Buddhist and Jain literature also mention forest tribes inhabiting the eastern and southern forests, often calling them Atavika or Nishada communities.</li>

          <li>Although the region remained outside the mainstream Indo-Aryan power centres, it had trade contact with Magadha, Vaishali, and Anga. Traders passed through the region, exchanging salt, metals, and forest products.</li>

        Magadha’s influence extended slightly into present-day Hazaribagh, Palamu, and Santhal Pargana. Mauryan rule under Ashoka introduced minor forest administration, but not full governance. Gupta inscriptions mention forest tribes paying tribute, showing nominal contact. Throughout this time, tribal social structures remained intact.

    <div class="card-content">
      <p>
       

        After the British gained Diwani rights in 1765, they attempted to establish control over forested Jharkhand. Their land revenue policies disrupted tribal communal land ownership. British-appointed zamindars and moneylenders (dikus) took over tribal land, causing resentment. Early resistance came from the Paharias, who challenged British expansion and raided plains in retaliation to oppression.

        The Santhal hero Tilka Manjhi led one of India’s earliest tribal revolts against British rule. Angered by exploitation and oppressive policies, Tilka attacked British officers, including Augustus Cleveland. After months of guerrilla resistance, he was captured and brutally executed. His sacrifice ignited a wave of resistance throughout the region.

        Triggered by land seizures, forced labor, and exploitation by moneylenders, the Kol tribes (Munda, Ho, Oraon) launched a massive revolt across Ranchi, Gumla, Khunti, Singhbhum, and Hazaribagh. Thousands participated, attacking police stations and administrative offices. British suppression was brutal. The revolt highlighted that tribal lands could not be governed through British revenue practices.

       One of the greatest tribal uprisings in Indian history, the Santhal Rebellion was led by Sidho, Kanho, Chand, and Bhairav Murmu. Land alienation, exploitation by zamindars, and harsh British policies provoked Santhals to declare self-rule. Over 60,000 Santhals built a parallel administration but were eventually crushed by the British. This led to the creation of Santhal Pargana, providing administrative protections.

       The Ulgulan or “Great Tumult,” led by Birsa Munda, is the most iconic movement in Jharkhand’s history. Birsa emerged as a social reformer, prophet, and revolutionary, urging tribal people to reclaim their land and reject British rule. His movement attacked police stations, landlords, and missionaries. Birsa’s arrest and mysterious death in 1900 sparked outrage. His movement forced the British to enact the Chotanagpur Tenancy Act (1908), protecting tribal land rights. Birsa Munda became a symbol of tribal pride.

      Restricted transfer of tribal lands to non-tribals.

      Santhal Pargana Tenancy Act

      Protected Santhal land rights.

      Wilkinson’s Rules (1837)

      Special legal framework for Kolhan.
